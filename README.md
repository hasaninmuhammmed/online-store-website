## introduction

### The goal of this project is to design a special store website in order to sell goods on the Internet. The current site lacks colors that attract the viewer, and the site design is old. It must be designed to keep pace with artificial intelligence in order to adapt to our current times. A redesigned website should be attractive, user-friendly, and optimized for mobile devices

### 3. Modern Design: A new design should have a modern, clean aesthetic. Attractive colors and beautiful button design
### 4. Improving the organization of products: Products must be organized so that each product is in its own section, and products of the same category must appear below the product.
### 5. Enhanced visuals: The website should use high-quality images, videos, and graphics to enhance the product presentation.
### 6. Social Media Integration: The website should be integrated with our social media platforms, allowing users to easily share content and follow us on social media.
### 7. Search Engine Optimization (SEO): A website should be optimized for search engines to improve organic rankings and increase visibility. Proper HTML tags, meta descriptions and keyword optimization should be implemented.
