# online-store-website
## introduction

### The goal of this project is to design a special store website in order to sell goods on the Internet. The current site lacks colors that attract the viewer, and the site design is old. It must be designed to keep pace with artificial intelligence in order to adapt to our current times. A redesigned website should be attractive, user-friendly, and optimized for mobile devices
## requirements
### 1. Responsive design: A website should be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. The design and content should be adjusted accordingly to provide an optimal viewing experience.
### 2. User-friendly navigation: The website should have a clear and intuitive navigation menu that allows users to easily find the product they are looking for. The menu should be consistent across all pages and provide easy access to important products.
### 3. Modern Design: A new design should have a modern, clean aesthetic. Attractive colors and beautiful button design
### 4. Improving the organization of products: Products must be organized so that each product is in its own section, and products of the same category must appear below the product.
### 5. Enhanced visuals: The website should use high-quality images, videos, and graphics to enhance the product presentation.
### 6. Social Media Integration: The website should be integrated with our social media platforms, allowing users to easily share content and follow us on social media.
### 7. Search Engine Optimization (SEO): A website should be optimized for search engines to improve organic rankings and increase visibility. Proper HTML tags, meta descriptions and keyword optimization should be implemented.
### 8. Contact Form: The website should include a contact form that allows users to contact us easily. The form must record the user's name, email address, and message, and must be sent to a designated email address upon submission.
## Achievements
### 1. Wireframes: A set of wireframes that define the layout of each department and its products.
### 2. Visual Design Mockups: High-resolution visual design mockups of the site's home page and main internal pages.
### 3. Front-end development: HTML, CSS and JavaScript code for the redesigned website.
### 4. Testing: Comprehensive testing of website functionality and cross-browser compatibility.
### 5. Deployment: Deploy the redesigned website on our hosting server.
